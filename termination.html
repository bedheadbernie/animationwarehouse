<h2>Termination Explanation</h2>
<hr></br>

<strong>This is an explanation as to why my YouTube channel was terminated, and my efforts to get it reinstated. Click the thumbnails to open them in a new tab. Apologies for the very primitive layout, just wanted to get this out quickly with an emphasis on the writing and images.
</strong></br></br>

On May 3rd, at around 3:45 AM, I submitted 3 takedown notifications against re-uploads I had found of my videos. One of these was a copy of my recent Steven Universe video, while the other two were clones of my Cartoonbrew video. </br></br>

And yes, I have watched them to make sure they are, in fact, re-uploads that didn't substantially transform my content. If you are interested, a link to each of them is available below:

</ul>

Above is an example of one of the forms I filled out to file the claims. They're all similar enough that I feel it's unneccesary to provide all of them. All of my personal information has been blacked out for privacy. Note that for the description, I selected that “My YouTube video was reuploaded by another user”, and that “it appears for the entire video”. On a technical level, this is true.</br></br>

After talking it over with some friends, I went to sleep, and assumed that the cases were being handled by the appropriate people. Cut to 7 PM the next day, when all of a sudden I was signed out of my Google account, and had to log back in using mobile verification. Once re-verified, I received a new email in my inbox stating my YouTube channel had been terminated for not complying with the site’s terms of services.</br></br>

<div align="center"><a href="assets/termination/image3.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" src="assets/termination/image3.png"></a></div></br>

This seemed to have come out of nowhere at the time, so I first concluded it was a result of some sort of mass false flagging campaign. I decided to send a message to YouTube’s through their <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40039?p=youtube">support form</a> to try and figure out what went wrong; this is what I got as a response.</br></br>

<div align="center"><a href="assets/termination/image4.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" src="assets/termination/image4.png"></a></div></br>

Apparently, I was suspended for inserting ‘fraudulent information into their legal web forms’; these ‘legal web forms’ are their copyright claim submission system. They then state that I could have defended myself by replying to an email they sent with an attached  message. This confused me, because I had never recalled seeing a message like this. So I searched, and it wasn’t in my inbox. So I checked through the trash and spam folders, and there it was. For whatever reason, the entire conversation had been automatically deleted (it may have been caught by one of my filters). It contained copies of the reports I submitted, along with the automated concerns telling me that they were questioning the information presented on the forms.</br></br>

<div align="center"><a href="assets/termination/image5.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" src="assets/termination/image5.png"></a></div></br>

My first assumption upon finding these messages was that I got my personal info wrong… but after looking it over, the inputs were correct. So then I went back to the videos I attempted to claim, and compared them to my own; only then did I realize that they actually HAD been slightly altered. The two reuploads of my CartoonBrew videos were cut to be shorter by 3 seconds, and the Steven Universe mirror had a still frame in the intro. I assume what happened was that because I had labelled them as ‘entire re-uploads’, YouTube's bots simply compared them side by side. I guess they must have been different enough to pass the bot, because they viewed all 3 of my submissions as invalid. And thus, I was terminated.</br></br>

<div align="center"><a href="assets/termination/image6.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" src="assets/termination/image6.png"></a></div></br>

I don't want to shift the blame entirely here; I did make a mistake, and I selected the wrong option on the form. But I’m still the actual copyright holder, and I acted in entirely good faith; there’d be no incentive to lie about this! After realizing that this was all just a huge misunderstanding, I attempted to get into contact with YouTube's staff so I could get this properly sorted out privately. I started by replying to the message they told me to from the support form with an explanation.</br></br>


<div align="center"><a href="assets/termination/image7.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" src="assets/termination/image7.png"></a></div></br>

24 hours later, no response.</br></br>


I decided to give another shot, and sent an even more detailed response to EVERY relevant notification they’ve sent me.</br></br>

<div align="center"><a href="assets/termination/image8.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" src="assets/termination/image8.png"></a></div></br>

24 hours later, still no response.</br></br>


I even tried to submit a new appeal to their support desk again, but apparently because I had asked for the clarification from them earlier they counted THAT as my only appeal.</br></br>

<div align="center"><a href="assets/termination/image9.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" src="assets/termination/image9.png"></a></div></br>

<h3>So, in summary;</h3></br>

<ul>
<li>They’ve banned me from the entire platform over a misunderstanding in which I am still in the legal right.</li>
<li>I’ve exhausted any means of communicating with staff that are relevant to this situation, with no response 24 hours+</li>
<li>and finally, they’re continuing to allow illegal re-uploads of my copyrighted material remain on their website.</li>

</ul>
