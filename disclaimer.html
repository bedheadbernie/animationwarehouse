<h2>Defending my series under 'fair use'.</h2>
<hr></br>

<strong>This document is intended to justify why I believe that if legally pressed, my content could be successfully defended under fair use.</strong></br></br>

A  <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/precedent" target="_blank">precedent</a> is a legal case that establishes a principle and/or ruling to be used in later disputes with similar issues. As of the time I am writing this, my series '<a href="https://www.bedheadbernie.com/" target="_blank">The Animation Warehouse</a>' has never been cleared by any sort of legal authority. However, I believe that by going off of the principles set by previous successful defenses of fair use, there is a strong argument that it very well could. I aknowledge the fact that unless your work has been cleared by a qualified lawyer, you cannot and should not claim that it actually will fall under 'fair use'.</br>

<h3>What is Fair Use?</h3>

'Fair use' is a limitation of a copyright holders' exclusive right to reproduce their own work. It is strictly prohibited to interpretative and/or transformative usages. While there is no criteria for what qualifies as a 'fair use', there have been many cases in which the defendant was able to successfully defend their work using fair use.</br></br>

The following are the four factors judges use to resolve disputes of fair use, via <a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/" target="_blank">Stanford's 'Copyright & Fair Use' Library</a>. While helpful, even they are not set in stone and typically are adapted on a case-by-case basis. A more indepth explanation of each factor is available through the link provided.</br>

 <ol>
  <li>The purpose and character of your usage.</li>
  <li>The nature of the copyrighted work.</li>
  <li>The amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and</li>
  <li>The effect of the use upon the potential market.</li>
</ol> 

"In particular, U.S. courts have recognized the following fair uses: criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, research and parodies."</br

<h3>Applicable Precedents Set By Successful Cases of Fair Use</h3>
Below are a list of usages allowed by the court that are applicable to my series. These have been identified by the <a href="assets/copyright_fair_use.pdf" target="_blank">Documentary Filmmakers’ Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use.</a></br>

<ul>
<li>Commenting Critically on Media</li>
<li>Sampling popular culture to portray societal conditions </li>
<li>Incorporating incidental sounds and images in documentary footage</li>
<li>Employing archival material in historical or biographical sequences</li>
</ul>

A list of specific cases is availible at the Center for Media and Social Impact's page of  <a href="http://cmsimpact.org/resource/examples-of-successful-fair-use-in-documentary-film/" target="_blank">'Successful Fair Use in Documentary Films'</a>.</br></br>

If required, I am willing to break down any specific videos the rightsholder holds issue with, and explain why I believe my usage of the clips do not legally require the copyright holder's permission. For further information on fair use, please refer to the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>, and the video '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S521VcjhvMA" target="_blank">Fair Use Legal Experts Answer Fair Use Questions</a>'.</br></br>

Thank you for taking the time to verify that my usage may not actually violate copyright.</br></br>
